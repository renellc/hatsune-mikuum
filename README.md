# HatsuneMikuum
Feeling down in the dumps? Are the VC's a little empty tonight? Fear not, HatsuneMikuum is here to fill that void!

*Don't ask why I made this.*

## Requirements
- [ffmpeg](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) - Make sure to have ffmpeg on your PATH, otherwise HatsuneMikuum won't be able to emit audio when in a voice channel.
- A tolerance for very high pitched noises.
